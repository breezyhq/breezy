## Manifesto
---

### Getting Started
`npm install`
`npm run dev`


### Commands
##### `npm run dev` - Starts the server, watching files

More to come soonish


### Cleanup
Occassionally run node /usr/lib/node_modules/coffee-unused/index.js --src ./src and clean up unused vars

More for just clean code vs reduced bundle size. As of 1/19 have only done for src/models and it only saved ~120b gzipped

- IMPORTANT:
  - css grid fn (should be in css, not in js/html classname)
    - https://medium.com/@christinevallaure/understand-css-grid-in-5-minutes-and-translate-into-responsive-sketch-files-fa0caca14ce3
    - eg grid(1fr 3fr 2fr) ?
    - ideally a way to specify grid width on different screen sizes too?
      - i think there's a min size breakpoint that might do that automatically?
  - container fn (max-width what g-grid used to do)


- loading message when onboarding (slow w/ lots of contribs)
- fix subdomain entityinfo pg


- notifications page coming soon
- login redirect to dashboard


- figure out entity_users and which entity to show by default
  **

- connections / org boxes
- threads
- get navigation working

- manually upsert threads?
- manually upsert metrics, or just use hardcoded for now?


- if org/fund is in our system (not just irs), have those show differently in entity search?
